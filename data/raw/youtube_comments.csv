Lymphoedema occurs due to damage of the lymphatic vessels. There is dilatation of lymph vessels and normal contractibility is lost (lymphatic vessels carry lymph; its damage causes improper drainage that results in oedema/swelling). Our treatment procedures result in the drainage of lymph, possibly through collateral circulation. As is the case in heart diseases and diabetes, lymphoedema is also not completely curable but we have observed that, following treatment, control of infection and a significant reduction in swelling occurs due to which the patient can return to normal activities. For best results, Lymphoedema/Filariasis patients have to be on long term and often life-long treatment.",,filariasis
